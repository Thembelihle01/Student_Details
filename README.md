The programme consists of four classes. One of these classes is a parent class that the child classes inherit from.
We have the following classes:
login
student form
diploma
degree
How the program works is that once a student login with proper credentials, they are able to access the student form.
Once they fill in their details and choose the type of qualification they will be doing, the system will either tell them if they qualify for a discount or not.
